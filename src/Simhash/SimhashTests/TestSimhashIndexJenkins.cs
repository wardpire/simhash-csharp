            testData.Add(2, "Written by: Gary Morrow \n 10/01/15 - 2:15 PM EDT \n \n \nTickers in this article: \n  IBM \n \n   \nNEW YORK (TheStreet) -- IBM  is drifting lower at midday on Thursday after beginning the session slightly higher. \n\nAt this morning's early high, the stock bumped up against heavy trend line resistance that capped the August and September highs. With today's rejection at this key level, IBM is becoming vulnerable to further downside. For IBM investors, an upcoming retest of major support will be critical. \n  As October begins, it appears IBM is headed for its third straight lower monthly low. This current downtrend, which began on July 21 with a huge downside gap, has dropped shares nearly 20%. Late last month, the initial down leg of the post-earnings breakdown found support near $140. IBM began to rebound on Aug. 26, but the upside was well-contained. With very light bullish interest, despite the steep decline from the summer highs, the stock was unable to move past its massive Aug. 24 opening gap. Shares have been trading in a tight range since while the major indices went on to recover most of the mid-August selloff. The significant lagging action continues to weigh on Big Blue and will likely drive it lower in the near term.  IBM will soon retest a major support zone between the $141-to-$138 area. The stock's August spike low marks the upper band of this area while the 1999 peak sits at $138.35. On a long-term chart, the 1999 high near $138.50 was a major turning point. This level was not taken out until the fourth quarter of 2010. Once through, IBM began a monster bull run that carried shares over 55% above the stock's 1999 high. \nInvestors should keep a close on eye on this zone. A solid base here, along with a divergent moving average convergence/divergence indicator , could provide a very attractive entry opportunity for patient bulls.");

During that time, they have to pay interest to the lender.\nThis week, Apple's stock has fallen almost 6 percent, suggesting short sellers wrapping up their bets may have made money.    \nShort selling in Apple increased from 1.1 percent of its outstanding shares in July to 1.6 percent in mid-September, although that level of short selling remained below the average rate of 2.7 percent for tech companies, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nSince a selloff in Chinese equities in late August, Apple's stock has fallen about 7 percent, slightly less than the S&P 500's 9 percent decline. \nBrad Lamensdorf, who manages the AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF, is currently short Apple shares. He suspects investors are overestimating iPhone sales in future quarters and he believes recent trading volume in Apple shares hints at more weakness to come.\nHe also likes shorting Apple because he doesn't have to compete with other short sellers to borrow the company's shares.\n\"We don't like to get into highly crowded 'war shorts' that people have been in forever,\" he said. \"Apple is the cheapest to borrow. There's plenty of supply and it's the lowest rate they'll charge you.\"\n (Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)\n");
